 - flycaptureSaveImage() can now save images in PPM, PGM, BMP, and RAW formats.
 - Implemented bug 2513 - yCap can now save images in PPM, PGM, BMP, and RAW 
   formats.
 - Implemented bug 2512 - Rewrote event size calculation code in ImageEventEx
   to use the new API function flycaptureGetPacketInfo().
 - Fixed bug 2520 - Custom image raw16 pixel format not colour processed 
   properly.
 - Fixed bug 2540 - Now checking invalid pixel formats for 
   flycaptureStartCustomImage() and reporting FLYCAPTURE_INVALID_MODE when
   appropriate.
 - Fixed bug 2177 - The camera start functions will no longer guess at an 
   appropriate video mode and frame rate if invalid parameters are passed in
   use FLYCAPTURE_VIDEOMODE_ANY and FLYCAPTURE_FRAMERATE_ANY to start the 
   camera in its current mode and framerate.
 - Fixed bug 2556 - We were responding to some USB 2.0 bus notification
   messages.
 - Implemented bug 2504 - DriverControlGUI is now included in the distribution.
   DriverControlGUI is an experimental program to provide driver selection
   functionality.
 - A note on 1394b and Windows XP Service Pack 2:  If you are a Dragonfly
   Express user and are running Windows XP Service Pack 2, you must run the
   fixSP2g.exe program in the 'bin' directory of the FlyCapture installation.
   1394b support was removed by Microsoft for Service Pack 2, and the 
   fixSP2g.exe program automatically downgrades the Windows 1394 drivers to 
   their SP1 state.  This is a temporary kludge until Microsoft comes out with 
   a hotfix to correct this problem.  This is PGR internal bug 2550 and bug
   2442.


1.5 Alpha 11 (7 September 2004)

 - Implemented bug 1842.  We now report the low-level bus number and node 
   number of devices in the FlyCaptureInfoEx structure.  This is only useful
   if you have multiple 1394 cards in your machine.  New API function:
   flycaptureBusEnumerateCamerasEx().
 - Implemented bug 2342.  Completely new implementation of 
   flycaptureSyncForLockNext().
 - Fixed bug 2196 - Non 8-bit custom image modes now work.

   control dialog.
 - Fixed bug 2412 - We now properly handle 1394b modes, including S800.  Please
   note that S800 is currently broken in Windows XP Service Pack 2.  We do not 
   recommend installing SP2.  This is PGR Bug 2442.


1.5 Alpha 10 (22 June 2004)

 - Fixed bug 1854 - SaveToImageEx enhancements.
 - Fixed bug 1067 and bug 1475 - Initializing camera when in custom image mode
   now behaves correctly.
 - Implemented bug 1663 - The library now no longer saves camera setting to the
   registry when flycaptureStop() is called, and no longer restores them 
   upon flycaptureInitialize().  There are a new pair of buttons in the
   camera settings dialog that now perform these functions.
 - Fixed bug 2206 - SaveToAviEx couldn't compile without DDK installed.
 - Implemented bug 2100 - FlyCap now drives home the fact that the user
   has to hit F9 to start capturing images for an .avi.
 - Fixed bug 2244 - Spurious bus reset messages in flycap.
 - Fixed bug 2233 - Internal threads not shutting down immediately on
   flycaptureDestroyContext().
 - Addressed bug 1996 - Heap corruption probably because of bug 2233.
 - New structure: FlyCaptureInfoEx.
 - New API function: flycaptureGetInfo().


1.5 Alpha 09 (27 May 2004)

 - Implemented bug 853 - Save to BMPs.
 - Implemented bug 2088 - Added flycaptureSaveImage() API function and
   FlyCaptureImageFileFormat enumeration.  flycaptureWritePPM() has been
   deprecated.  Please see API documentation for more information.

   contests in one process.


1.5 Alpha 08 (11 May 2004)

 - Implemented bug 2042.  flycaptureSetGrabTimeoutEx() now sets the timeout for 
   flycaptureLockNext() as well as the lock latest and grab calls.
 - Implemented bug 1423, bug 2087 - Partial image notification functionality.
   New structures: FlyCaptureImageEvent New functions: 
    - flycaptureInitializeNotify()
	- flycaptureLockNextEvent()
	- flycaptureWaitForImageEvent()
	- flycaptureUnlockEvent()
   Please see API documentation in flycaptureplus.h and the new example, 
   ImageEventEx.  Please note that to use this functionality, you need a
   hotfix from Microsoft. (It might be included in XP SP2, however.)  Please
   context PGR for information on how to aquire this fix to the 1394 subsystem.


1.5 Alpha 07 (5 May 2004)

 - Fixed bug 1134 - We now respond to and pass FLYCAPTURE_MESSAGE_BUS_RESET
   messages for all 1394 bus resets.
 - Added a secondary frame rate to the FlyCap display.  The new frame rate (the
   middle value in the status bar) indicates the display rate of the images.
   The first frame rate, which also appears in the title bar of the app is the
   camera grab rate.
 - Implemented bug 1902 - Added FLYCAPTURE_DEPRECATED error code for deprecated
   functions.
 - Implemented bug 2095 - Implemented flycaptureSetGrabTimeoutEx().
   flycaptureSetGrabTimeout() is now deprecated and will stop functioning soon.
 - Fixed bug 2119 - Handle leak on start()/stop()/start().


1.5 Alpha 06 (21 April 2004)

 - A PixelFormat argument has been added to 
   flycaptureStartLockNextCustomImage().  This must be provided.  Use 
   flycaptureQueryCustomImage() to find out what pixel formats the camera 
   supports.  Please see the CustomImageEx example for more information.
 - Added .avi saving functionality to FlyCap.  To save an .avi clip, start the
   camera with the red play button for recording mode.  Fill out the dialog,
   then hit F9 or use the menu item to save an .avi clip.  Hit F9 again to save
   another clip.  (it will clobber the file.)  To save a clip when in custom 
   image mode, do the following:  Star the camera the normal way (green play
   buttom), go into custom image mode using the dialog.  Stop the camera by
   unclicking the green play button.  Click the red record play button.  You
   are now in record mode with a custom image size.  This non-intuitiveness
   is documented in PGR bug 2002 and will be corrected soon.
 - .avi clip saving in FlyCap ignores the legacy 2GB limit on .avi files.  To
   split avi files so that they can be played with legacy video players, we
   recommend VirtualDub, http://virtualdub.org.  This is PGR bug 2001.
 - Fixed bug 2009 - Removed sometimes-annoying error dialog boxes.
 - Fixed bug 1893 - Better error reporting in SaveToAviEx when it can't write
   to the destination path.

 - Switched the numbering scheme of PGRFLYCAPTURE_VERSION.  The first digit
   is the major version, the second two are the minor version, the 4th is
   the build type, and the last two are the build number.  105002 is 1.5 Alpha 
   (0) 2.


1.5 Alpha 27 (1 October 2003)

 - This is the first 1.5 alpha release.  YOU MUST RECOMPILE YOUR CODE.  There

 - Fixed bug 1499 - Fix for bug 1495 caused unpredictable behaviour in Win2000
                    and hang in XP.  Unfortunately this means that stopping the
		    camera while it is blocked waiting for an image in external 
		    trigger mode might cause problems.

			  EXECUTABLES THAT USE PGRCAMERAGUI.DLL.  The API is
			  the same, and it is still exposed by pgrcameragui.h.
			  There will be some future deprecations in API functions.
			  Please see pgrcameragui.h for details.  This change
			  will encourage future compatibility between SDKs.
