   '  This structure defines the format by which time is represented in the 
   '  PGRFlycapture SDK.  The ulSeconds and ulMicroSeconds values represent the
   '  absolute system time when the image was captured.  The ulCycleSeconds
   '  and ulCycleCount are higher-precision values that have either been 
   '  propagated up from the 1394 bus or extracted from the image itself.  The 
   '  data will be extracted from the image if image timestamping is enabled and
   '  directly (and less accurately) from the 1394 bus otherwise.
   '
   '  The ulCycleSeconds value will wrap around after 128 seconds.  The ulCycleCount 
   '  represents the 1/8000 second component. Use these two values when synchronizing 
   '  grabs between two computers sharing a common 1394 bus that may not have 
   '  precisely synchronized system timers.
